# memory-cards-game

1- As a user, I want to see a landing page when I arrive at the website to know Iâ€™m in the right place.

2- As a user, I want to click a clearly visible "Start" button, so that I can begin playing the game.

3- As a user, when the game starts, I want to see eight cards displayed face-up with their images visible, so that I can briefly memorize their positions

4- As a user, I want the images on the cards to be turned face down after 3 seconds, so that I must rely on memory to find matching pairs.

5- As a user, I want to see a one-minute countdown timer, so that I know how much time I have left to find all matching pairs. 

6- As a user, I want to be able to click two cards at a time, and after selecting both, I want the game to tell me whether they match or not.

7- As a user, if I match all pairs before the timer runs out, I want to see a clear "You Win" message; if I do not match all pairs in time, I want to see a "You Lose" message.

8- As a user, after finishing a round, I want to have the option to play again.
